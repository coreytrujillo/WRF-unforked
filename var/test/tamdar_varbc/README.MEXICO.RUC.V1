WRFDA_MEXICO_V1 Release Notes  (May 2, 2016)

Namelist files in namelist_example folder for reference.


1. GOES imager data assimilation

   To use GOES imager, turn on use_goesimgobs (wrfvar4)

   Some coeff and info files about GOES imager are added in crtm_coeffs and radiance_info folders.

   Imager data should be linked to HDF4IMAGER-13.hdf in working directory, e.g. 

      ln -sf clavrx_goes13_*.level2.hdf ./HDF4IMAGER-13.hdf


2. Variational bias correction of TAMDAR temperature or/and specific humidity

   To use VARBC for TAMDAR, turn on use_varbc_tamdar and copy/link VARBC_TAMDAR.in in working directory.
   
   Some useful information will be written in varbc_tamdar_log.

   Namelist options available (default,wrfvar4) :

       use_varbc_tamdar=0              (0=false,1=varbc,2 for future)
       varbc_tamdar_var=F,F            (turn on/off varbc for T and Q when use_varbc_tamdar=1)
       varbc_tamdar_nobsmin=8          (minimum observation number in a flight to use varbc)
       varbc_tamdar_param_sen=0.33,0.2 (sensitivity of parameter change)
       varbc_tamdar_nbgerr=500.0       (constant for preconditioning of control variable)
       varbc_tamdar_tiv=1.5            (if T observation number in a flight < 4, these data will be set with qc=-55, &
                                        however, the data will be recovered to qc=55 for use if the OMB < 0.8)
       varbc_tamdar_qiv=0.001          (same as varbc_tamdar_tiv, but for specific humidity) 
       varbc_tamdar_tune_bc=0.1        (coefficient of bias model)


   An example here :
       a.  to use varbc only for T
       b.  observations in a flight, say id=0559, will be set with qc=-55 if observation number is less than 6
       c.  if OMB of any observation in 0559 is less than 1.34, the observation is set with qc=55 and used in DA (but not varbc)

       use_varbc_tamdar=1
       varbc_tamdar_var=T,F 
       varbc_tamdar_nobsmin=6
       varbc_tamdar_tiv=1.34 



3. Hybrid Dual-Res

   To use dual-res, turn on hybrid_dual_res (wrfvar16) 

   ep for d01 will be used in hybrid DA on d02
   
   fg for d01 is needed for map information in hybrid DA on d02, named by fg_ens:

      if [[ $domain == 02 ]]; then
         ln -sf ${d_blend}/d01/${current_date}/fg ./fg_ens
      fi

   Note that max_dom should be set for options in &time_control,&domain and &physics



4. Background error covariance (generated by NMC method, CV5, 51 vertical levels)
 
   be_d01.dat_cv5 and be_d02.dat_cv5 in ~/var/run
